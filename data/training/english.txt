In the shadow of the church stood a small, key-shaped manor. From the flat roof, covered with shingles, modest inns and cottages stretched out to the left, while to the right was an old, almost ruined rectory, in front of which was a spacious garden. In the pond in front of the manor, illuminated by the sun, three bellowing cows waded knee-deep in mud. On the shore stood an old wooden cross, standing in the water. On the wall of the house, near the gate, which a half-opened handle covered with a tent of mottled white linen, hung a rusty bell, which rang with great difficulty during services.

The manor was called Mostowo. In it lived an old district official who began his life here, at the beginning of his service. Inside was a small, low, ugly, but clean apartment, in which it wasn't too comfortable, but it was a home. The main room was bright, though it only had one window on one side, and on the wall hung paintings in golden frames, portraits, crosses, and pictures, and on the mantelpiece stood a horse in a silver horseshoe. Embracing the official, who sat in an old armchair with frayed sleeves, and his wife, who worked at the bench, knitting something with needles, there were many young people who were staying here for various reasons.

The district official had three sons. The eldest of them, Józef, was twenty-four years old and was already in his fourth year of philology studies. The second, Jan, at the age of twenty, had just finished his studies at a technical school. The third, Gustaw, was still attending high school and was sixteen years old. The mother had one daughter, Zofia, a beautiful, shapely, lively girl of eighteen, who was her joy and proud hope. Finally, as an adopted child, he had to raise another young man who had lived with them since childhood.


Mr. Józef used to get up very early. Before dawn, he was already up and about, moving around the dark house while everyone else slept. Soon the windows of his room would light up, where a candle was already burning as he prepared for work. During the long winter months, constant work became his routine.

The manor, which he took care of along with his siblings, was not only his home but also his workshop. It was hard to understand how he could endure the smell of dust and dampness that prevailed in those rooms, which were full of people working from morning till night.

First, he had to sit down to study, and then he had to rush to the town, where various activities related to his studies awaited him. Whenever he left Mostowo, his mother would urge him to avoid company and not to waste time talking to strangers.

Józef knew that the company awaiting him in town was not always the most suitable, and that he had to be careful with strangers. Nevertheless, when the opportunity arose, he often spent late hours in taverns, exchanging views with unknown people who occupied the seat next to him.

He knew it was dangerous, but what did it matter? Student life had its charms, and he wanted to enjoy all its pleasures.

Returning home from such outings, he often had to walk a long way in silence and darkness. Sometimes, as he walked through the forest, he thought he heard footsteps behind him, and his heart began to beat faster. But he quickly remembered what his mother had told him and quickened his pace, trying to reach a safe shelter as quickly as possible.


The days of the passing summer in Mostowo went by peacefully and monotonously. Mr. Jan and Gustaw returned to school, while Mr. Józef delved even deeper into his studies. Zofia took care of the household chores, helping her mother with managing the estate.

The routine at the manor did not differ much from previous years. The district official continued to devote most of his time to his work, taking care of both official matters and the well-being of the family. His wife, although suffering from various ailments, did not neglect the household duties.

The approaching autumn painted the landscape around Mostowo with beautiful colors. The leaves of the trees turned golden and red, and the nights grew increasingly colder. Silence reigned around the manor, interrupted only by the sounds of agricultural work and the noises of nature.

Józef increasingly pondered over his future. Although he valued his studies, he felt that life in the countryside limited his opportunities. He longed to see the world, to travel, to develop his interests.

Meanwhile, Zofia dreamed of finding the right life partner. Although there was no shortage of bachelors in the area vying for her attention, she felt that she must make the right choice to ensure happiness and stability in the future.

In the meantime, Jan and Gustaw immersed themselves in their school duties, striving to achieve the best results in their studies. Although it was not always easy for them, they gave their all to meet their father's expectations and obtain a good education.

Thus, life in Mostowo continued its peaceful course, amidst daily responsibilities and dreams of a better future.
